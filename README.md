## Purpose of the project
<p> (1) Make videos of shintyan（新ちゃん）, a Japanese cartoon character, moving around in noisy background; and
<p> (2) Train a deep learning model to detect the position of shintyan

## shintyan_detection.ipynb
<p> where the experiment runs

## codes
<p> video.py: used to make videos
<p> model.py: used to get the model for training

## models
<p> where trained models reside

## pickle_files
<p> where labelled data generated in the main program reside

## other
<p> shin2.jpg: pic of shintyan
<p> test_output.avi: final output of the experiment, a video of shintyan moving in noisy background with a box trying to capture it (doesn't exist now; will be created after the last chuck of code is run in the shintyan_detection.ipynb)
